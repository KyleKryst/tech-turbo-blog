## Description ##
My motivation to make this project was to have a CMS-style blog site. I built this project so that I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions. Now with this project completed, I have furthered my knowledge in the MVC paradigm and using Handlebars.js as well as express-session. I also used Bulma for the first time.
